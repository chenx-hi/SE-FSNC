# Structural Entropy Guided Meta Learning for Few-shot Node Classification

Figure 1: An illustration of our motivation about the minimal and sufficient meta-knowledge *Z* in Proposition 1. When *Z* contains information about the graph structure *G* and base class *Y<sub>b</sub>* that is unrelated to the novel class *Y<sub>n</sub>*, it could result in overfitting.

(a) Stage 1: Bottom-up Build Two-dimensional Encoding Trees

(b) Stage 2: Top-down Combine Two-dimensional Encoding Trees to Build Higher-dimensional Encoding Tree
